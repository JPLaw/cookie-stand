    <p>Hi! My name is Pat, and this is my family: my wife Patricia, my son Pate, and my daughter, Patia. Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies! Being from the Pacific NorthWest, I grew up on all kinds of salmon dishes. But, have you ever heard of salmon cookies? Probably not until today. Our cookies are fresh baked with local, responsibly farmed salmon. </p>
